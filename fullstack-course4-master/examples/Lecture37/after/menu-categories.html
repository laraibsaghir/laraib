      Technology plays an important role in our life. In this modern era, life is impossible without technology. Every person in the world who has access to technology takes advantage from it. Only the ones living in the villages with less facilities of life do not have proper access to technology. The village people neither have the facility of education nor they have office work. So, its not difficult for them to live without technology. But the ones who go to offices and the children who study, use of technology is compulsory for them if they want to excel in their fields.Its okay if one uses technology for his/her benefits and try to move forward and have success in their work. One cannot deny the importance of technology and it’s a fact that technology has made our lives easier and turned the world into a global village. We all are connected with each other. Scientists make new inventions on daily basis and it wouldn’t have been possible without the internet. We can keep an eye on the news from all around the world just because of technology. Many people are free lancers who work from home and earn money. Businessmen make so many calls in a day and run the whole business from their phones. Little children also have made their names in the field of programming and have left many people behind by the correct use of technology. From booking online cabs to booking flight tickets, we use technology everywhere. Online shopping is also a benefit of technology. The advantages of technology are countless. Technology has given us a lot but have we ever questioned ourselves that what it has taken from us? I think the answer to this question is a big no. this is because we have become so much busy in our lives that we have stopped thinking about the things which are harming us like a slow poison. Its okay to use technology for your benefits but this is not the only case. There are people int this world who just use technology for their work but their number is very few. Most of the people especially the children and young people are addicted to social media and are playing with their lives. The constant use of technology has shortened our attention from 12 minutes to five minutes. Use of technology has affected our ability to learn, our productivity and our relationships. This is because all these things require a certain level of concentration. Most the people who are tech addicts think that they are very efficient as they can chat, watch videos and reply mails at the same time but this is not the case. We only reduce our brain efficiency this way and can’t retain information for a long time in our brains. Even the ones who use technology for their benefits have to admit that they also use it for pleasure (their kind of pleasure). But what they think is pleasuring them, in real is harming them. We spend hours scrolling the news feed. We cannot live without keeping a check on the notifications from different social media apps. We have not even realized that we most of us cannot even face to face interact with other people. Thanks to technology. We are constantly taking in new information, barely having enough time to think about it and commit it to memory before something else grabs our attention. This impacts our memory and makes us more forgetful. So above we have discussed some advantages and disadvantages of technology. We cannot say technology is bad. Nothing is good or bad. In the end it depends on a person, how he uses it. We should only use technology for our work and our benefits and also should take breaks of few minutes if we are continuously using it. We should try to break our social media addictions and should not let the children use the internet without keeping an eye on them.
